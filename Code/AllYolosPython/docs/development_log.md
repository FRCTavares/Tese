2025-07-29T14:30Z - User executed setup_realsense.sh to build Intel RealSense SDK from source - checking if installation succeeded
2025-07-29 19:36 - RealSense Python Bindings Progress

### Issue Resolution
- **Intel RealSense SDK**: Successfully built and installed system-wide (v2.54.1)
- **Python Bindings**: Initially not available in virtual environment
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Created symbolic links from system installation to venv
  - Added missing `__init__.py` file to make pyrealsense2 a proper Python package
  - Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include RealSense libraries

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ pyrealsense2 module is now importable in virtual environment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Camera initialization failing with "Couldn't resolve requests" error
- üîç Investigating: USB bandwidth or resolution compatibility issues

### Next Steps
1. Test different camera resolutions and frame rates
2. Check USB 3.0 connection and bandwidth
3. Verify D435 camera permissions and device detection
4. Consider fallback to lower resolutions for Pi 5 compatibility

### Command Used
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
source venv/bin/activate
python3 src/main.py --headless --width 320 --height 240
```

### Error Details
```
2025-07-29 19:36:49,596 - camera - ERROR - Failed to start RealSense camera: Couldn't resolve requests
```

This indicates the camera is detected but the requested stream configuration (320x240@30fps) is not supported or conflicts with USB bandwidth limitations.

## TODO: Further Performance Optimizations

### Model Pruning and Quantization
For even better Pi 5 performance, consider these advanced optimizations:

1. **Model Pruning** - Remove redundant parameters while maintaining accuracy
   - Use Ultralytics pruning utilities: https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#pruning
   - Target 30-50% pruning ratio for significant speedup
   - Command: `yolo train model=yolov8n.pt prune=0.3 data=custom_dataset.yaml`

2. **Advanced Quantization** - Beyond int8 to int4 or mixed precision
   - NCNN int8 quantization guide: https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/wiki/quantized-int8-inference
   - Post-training quantization with calibration dataset
   - Tools: `ncnn2int8` for automatic quantization

3. **Model Architecture Optimization**
   - Use YOLOv8s instead of YOLOv8n for better accuracy vs speed trade-off
   - Custom architecture with fewer classes for specialized use cases
   - Ultralytics slimming tutorial: https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/export/#model-optimization

4. **Input Optimization** 
   - Experiment with lower resolutions (320x240, 416x416)
   - Use letterboxing to maintain aspect ratio
   - Implement dynamic resolution based on detection confidence

5. **Inference Optimization**
   - TensorRT conversion for NVIDIA Jetson (if switching from Pi 5)
   - OpenVINO for Intel-based systems
   - ARM NN for native ARM optimization

6. **System-level Optimizations**
   - CPU governor settings: `sudo cpufreq-set -g performance`
   - Memory allocation optimizations
   - Camera buffer management
   - Multi-threading for camera capture and inference

### Performance Targets
With full optimization pipeline on Pi 5:
- **Target FPS:** 25-30 FPS at 480x270
- **Memory usage:** <1.5GB total
- **Model size:** <2MB (with pruning + int8)
- **Latency:** <30ms inference time

### ‚úÖ MILESTONE ACHIEVED
- **Intel RealSense D435**: Successfully connected and streaming
- **Camera Serial**: 827312072100
- **Python Bindings**: Working in virtual environment
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8-nano running on real camera frames
- **Performance**: Real-time inference working

### Working Configuration
```bash
# Set environment variables
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
source venv/bin/activate

# Test with supported resolutions
python3 src/main.py --width 424 --height 240 --fps 30   # Low res, high FPS
python3 src/main.py --width 640 --height 480 --fps 30   # Standard VGA
python3 src/main.py --headless --width 640 --height 480  # Headless mode
```

### Supported D435 RGB Resolutions
- **424x240**: @ 30Hz/60Hz (optimal for Pi 5 performance)
- **640x480**: @ 30Hz (standard VGA, good balance)
- **1280x720**: @ 15Hz (HD, may be too heavy for real-time)
- **1920x1080**: @ 8Hz (Full HD, likely too slow)

### Key Findings
1. **Resolution Critical**: Must use exact supported camera resolutions
2. **Library Path**: LD_LIBRARY_PATH must include /usr/local/lib
3. **USB Bandwidth**: Pi 5 handles 640x480@30fps without issues
